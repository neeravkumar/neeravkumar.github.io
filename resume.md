## Devops Engineer

### [me@nero.im] | [@neeravkumar] | +65 86952625 | Singapore

## Summary

I am a 26 year Devops Engineer in Singapore. I had been coding in Visual Basic since school but shifted my interests to Web Development on Linux and PHP after I got admitted to the Bachelors of Technology(Computer Science and Engineering) program at NIT Allahabad(one of Indiaâ€™s top 20 engineering universities). I started developing sites for the various student-organised activities there and eventually progressed to administering the servers for the sites too. In 2009 I was chosen as a web developer cum system administrator for developing the online enrollment/counselling/seat allotment system and the infrastructure for NIMCET(an all india entrance examination for a graduate course in NITs). I was recruited as a Systems Developer via on-campus placement at MakeMyTrip in 2009 and joined there in July 2010 and in the few months there I built a project to do automated data-driven selenium testing for the site.
I started consulting as a Support Engineer with Webfaction in September 2010 and shifted to System Administration in May 2012 where I was the system administrator in the Asian shift. I joined VIKI as the devops engineer in October 2013 where I have led an effort since to transition the systems there to Docker.
