## Summary

I am a 24 year old system administrator working out of my home in Mumbai, India. I had been coding in Visual Basic since school but shifted my interests to Linux and PHP after I got admitted to the Bachelors of Technology(Computer Science and Engineering) program at NIT Allahabad(one of Indiaâ€™s top 20 engineering universities). I started developing sites for the various student- organised festivals there and eventually progressed to administering the servers for the sites too. In 2009 I was chosen as a web developer cum system administrator for developing the online enrollment/counselling/seat allotment system for NIMCET. I was recruited as a Systems Developer via on-campus placement at MakeMyTrip in 2009 and joined there in July 2010.
I started consulting as a Support Engineer with Webfaction in September 2010 and most recently shifted to System Administration in May 2012.
